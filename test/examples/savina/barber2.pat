### Waiting Room

## In the case that the barber is busy, we are waiting for a Next message,
## and our mailbox can contain many Enter messages and customer messages

## In the case that the barber is asleep, there won't be any waiting customers,
## and any Enter requests will need to transition us back to waitingRoom
